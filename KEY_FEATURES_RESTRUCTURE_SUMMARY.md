# Key Features Section Restructure - Summary

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 📊 Problem Identified

The insurance project README had **TWO "Key Features" sections**, causing redundancy and poor structure:

1. **First section (Line 17):** Brief bullet-point list  
2. **Second section (Line 191):** Detailed "Phase 1, 2, 3" breakdown (405 lines)

**Total duplicate content:** 405 lines
