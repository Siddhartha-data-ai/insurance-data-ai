2. **Detailed Analysis** - Table-by-table metrics, filtering, heatmaps
3. **Trends** - Historical quality trends, volume analysis
4. **Alerts** - Critical issues, warnings, recommendations

**Deployment:**
```bash
# Quick start
cd /Users/kanikamondal/Databricks/insurance-data-ai
./launch_dq_dashboard.sh

# Access at: http://localhost:8502
```

**Technology Stack:**
- Streamlit (web framework)
- Plotly (interactive visualizations)
- PySpark (data processing)
- Pandas (data manipulation)

## üí∞ 2. Cost Optimization Analysis

### Implementation Details

**Type:** Databricks Notebook with Comprehensive Analytics

**Location:** `src/analytics/cost_optimization_analysis.py`

**Features Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Storage cost analysis (by layer, by table)
- ‚úÖ Compute cost tracking (cluster usage, idle time)
- ‚úÖ Job performance metrics (runtime, efficiency, failures)
- ‚úÖ Automated optimization recommendations with priority levels
- ‚úÖ Estimated savings calculations (monthly and annual)
- ‚úÖ Interactive visualizations (cost breakdowns, trends)
- ‚úÖ Exportable cost reports (JSON format)
- ‚úÖ Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)

**Cost Metrics Tracked:**
1. **Storage Costs:**
   - Total data size across all layers
   - Cost per table
   - Monthly and annual projections
   - File count analysis (small file detection)

2. **Compute Costs:**
   - Cluster uptime and idle time
   - DBU consumption per cluster
   - Cost per cluster
   - Efficiency metrics

3. **Job Costs:**
   - Total job runs analyzed
   - Success vs failure rates
   - Average cost per job
   - Long-running job detection

**Recommendations Generated:**
- High Priority: Small file problems, idle clusters, failed jobs
- Medium Priority: Large unpartitioned tables, oversized clusters
- Low Priority: Performance optimization opportunities

**Example Output:**
```
üí∞ TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS:
  ‚Ä¢ Monthly: $1,164.15
  ‚Ä¢ Annual: $13,969.80

üí° TOTAL POTENTIAL SAVINGS:
  ‚Ä¢ Estimated Monthly Savings: $1,650.00
  ‚Ä¢ Estimated Annual Savings: $19,800.00
```

**Deployment:**
```
1. Open notebook in Databricks workspace
2. Set parameters (environment, days_lookback)
3. Run all cells
4. Review recommendations
```
