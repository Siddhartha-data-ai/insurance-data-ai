## 🚀 What You Need To Do (5 Simple Steps)

### **Step 1: Install Databricks CLI** (~2 minutes)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# If you have Homebrew:
brew tap databricks/tap
brew install databricks

# OR without Homebrew:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Verify:
```bash
databricks --version
# Should show: databricks version 0.2xx.x
```

---

### **Step 2: Authenticate** (~1 minute)

```bash
databricks auth login
```

This opens your browser → select workspace → done!

---

### **Step 3: Run the Deployment Script** (~5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/kanikamondal/Databricks/insurance-data-ai
./deploy_dlt_pipeline.sh
```

**That's it!** The script handles everything:
- ✅ Validates configuration
- ✅ Uploads DLT notebooks
- ✅ Creates the pipeline
- ✅ Shows you the pipeline ID

---

### **Step 4: Start the Pipeline** (~20 minutes execution)

**Option A: In Databricks UI** (Easier)
1. Go to: Workflows → Delta Live Tables
2. Click: `insurance_dev_bronze_to_silver_pipeline`
3. Click: **[Start]** button
4. Watch progress in Graph tab

**Option B: Command Line**
```bash
databricks pipelines start --pipeline-id $(cat .pipeline_id)
```

---

### **Step 5: Verify Success** (~2 minutes)

After pipeline completes:

1. **Check in UI**: Data Explorer → `insurance_dev_silver`
2. **Or run SQL**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM insurance_dev_silver.customers.customer_dim WHERE is_current = TRUE;
   -- Should show ~1,000,000 rows
   ```

---

## 📊 What Will Happen

### During Deployment:
```
📤 Uploading notebooks → Databricks workspace
✅ Creating DLT pipeline
✅ Configuring for dev environment
🎉 Pipeline ready to run!
```

### During Pipeline Execution:
```
📊 Loading bronze data
🔍 Validating data quality
✨ Applying transformations
💾 Writing to silver layer (with SCD Type 2)
📈 Generating quality metrics
✅ Complete!
```

### After Success:
```
✅ insurance_dev_silver catalog populated
✅ ~1M customers (with history tracking)
✅ ~2.5M policies
✅ ~375K claims
✅ Quality metrics available
✅ Ready for analytics & ML!
```

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

| Step | Time | What You Do |
|------|------|-------------|
| Install CLI | 2 min | Run one command |
| Authenticate | 1 min | Click in browser |
| Deploy | 5 min | Run script, confirm |
| Pipeline runs | 20 min | Watch (automatic) |
| Verify | 2 min | Check results |
| **Total** | **~30 min** | **Mostly automated!** |

## 🎯 Quick Start (TL;DR)

If you just want the commands:

```bash
# 1. Install
brew tap databricks/tap && brew install databricks

# 2. Authenticate
databricks auth login

# 3. Deploy
cd /Users/kanikamondal/Databricks/insurance-data-ai
./deploy_dlt_pipeline.sh

# 4. Start pipeline (in UI or run this)
databricks pipelines start --pipeline-id $(cat .pipeline_id)

# 5. Done! Check: Workflows → Delta Live Tables
```

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes:

**"Command not found: databricks"**
→ CLI not installed. See Step 1 above.

**"Not authenticated"**
→ Run: `databricks auth login`

**"Bundle validation failed"**
→ Make sure you're in project directory:
```bash
cd /Users/kanikamondal/Databricks/insurance-data-ai
```

**"Pipeline fails - table not found"**
→ Bronze data doesn't exist. Run bronze generation notebooks first on a regular cluster.

**"Permission denied"**
→ Create catalogs and grant permissions (see METHOD_3_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
