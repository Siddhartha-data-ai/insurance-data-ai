## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Notebook won't run**

**Check:**
1. Cluster is running
2. Cluster has Spark available
3. You're using the correct cluster

**Fix:** Restart cluster, then re-run notebook

---

### **Issue: "Table not found" error**

**Check:** Prediction tables exist

```sql
SHOW TABLES IN insurance_dev_gold.predictions;
```

**Should see:**
- customer_churn_risk
- fraud_alerts  
- claim_forecast
- premium_optimization

**Fix:** Re-run ML prediction notebooks if tables are missing

---

### **Issue: Bot doesn't understand my question**

**Solution:** Try rephrasing or use Quick Actions buttons

**The bot understands:**
- ✅ "Show me customers at risk"
- ✅ "High risk customers"
- ✅ "Churn risk"

**But struggles with:**
- ❌ "Tell me about stuff"
- ❌ "What's happening?"
- ❌ Very complex multi-part questions

**Tip:** Ask one thing at a time, then follow up!

---

### **Issue: Chatbot is slow**

**This is normal!** The first query takes ~30 seconds because it:
1. Connects to Spark
2. Queries your data
3. Generates visualizations

**Subsequent queries are much faster (~5 seconds)**

**Speed tips:**
- Keep the notebook running (don't stop cluster)
- Use "Show top 10" instead of "Show all"
- Ask specific questions rather than broad ones
